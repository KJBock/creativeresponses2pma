## About the Collection

This site is an online collection of photographs taken two former prisons sites in Northern Ireland.

These pictures were taken before the buildings have been torn down, to the most part as the hospital wing, a watchtower and one of the H-Blocks remain on the site of MLK Prison. 

If you want to find out more about the [Prisons Memory Archive](https://www.prisonsmemoryarchive.com/) visit our oral history collection online. 

More information about the prisons sites [Armagh Gaol]() and [Maze and Long Kesh Prison]() can be found in the context section. 

If the archival fever has taken hold of you why not visit the [Public Record Office Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/public-record-office-northern-ireland-proni) and their digital collection.

The history of the conflict and how it impacts our lives today can be difficult to understand. Here are some resources that might help you to brush up on this particular piece of history:

- McKittrick, D. and McVea, D. (2012) Making sense of the troubles:A history of the Northern Ireland conflict, London, Viking.
