## About the Collection

This website is an online collection to accompany the exhibition Creative Responses at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland.
The exhibition is on display on site from Monday, 6th of November until Friday 24th of November, 11am. 

This poster exhibition is part of a research project that explores the creative re-use of an audiovisual collection with the public. In seven workshops, participants designed posters as a creative response to the [Prisons Memory Archive](https://www.prisonsmemoryarchive.com/) Collection. 

Each response is different and is accompanied by a comment from the creator, which you can see on the right side next to the poster. You will also find all the archival resources that have been used to create a poster there. The reference numbers listed are from the [Public Record Office Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/public-record-office-northern-ireland-proni).

The various posters highlight the wide range of perspectives and interpretations of historic records.
Working together with members of the community can enrich the view we have of our past, present and future. 

If you want to find out more about the [Prisons Memory Archive](https://www.prisonsmemoryarchive.com/) visit our oral history collection online or at the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland.

## Acknowlegements

Hi, this is Katharina, the PhD researcher responsible for this project. I organized the workshops where these posters were made and put everything together for their public display at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland and Online.

This project would not have been possible without the contributors to the Prisons Memory Archive, thank you for sharing your stories with us.
And of course this exhibit came together thanks to all the people who joined the workshops and designed their individual creative responses - thank you. 

I am grateful for the feedback and support I received from the PMA Advisory Group and the team here at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland throughout the process.

A special thanks to Cahal McLaughlin for his feedback throughout the way, our PMA volunteer Órlaith and my friend Morgan for proofreading. 

This research project is funded by the Horizon 2020 MSCA co-fund action CITI-GENS at Queen’s University Belfast. The exhibition costs have been covered by QUB’s Imapct Acceleration Account.
