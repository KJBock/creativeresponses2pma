It felt to me like taking their picture all over again in a screenshot. I decided to use either a sepia or colour filter to be reminiscent of the 1970s, the time these women would have been in prison. I decided to contrast this with a shocking pink element. Pink is perceived as a standard female colour, but I made it shocking pink as back then it was (or might have been) shocking that women were involved in different crimes and that they were imprisoned, too.",,,,,,,,"The following archive resources have been re-used: PMA Recordings from Jackie Upton (D4616/2/1/4/1), Angela Nelson (D4616/2/1/89/1), Evelyn Brady and Cate Mackie (D4616/2/1/29/1)",https://apps.proni.gov.uk/eCatNI_IE/SearchPage.aspx,"Poster, Exhibition Number 01",poster_exno_01,"Stills from D4616/2/1/4/1, D4616/2/1/89/1 and D4616/2/1/29/1 reproduced with the permission of the Prisons Memory Archive and the Deputy Keeper of the Records Public Record Office of Northern Ireland",https://rightsstatements.org/page/InC/1.0/?language=en,Visual Art Poster,image/jpeg,eng,,,,,
poster_exno_02,poster_exno_02.jpg,Glossary brackets,2023,,Creative Writer,,"My idea was basically to use the glossary of Long Kesh terms to create a 'found poem'. Found poetry is when you take text from a non-poetic source, reframe and edit it, and then present the result as a poem. I chose words that had square brackets around the preceding definite article ‘the’ in the glossary: ‘[the] cage’, ‘[the] compounds’, etc. I felt the square brackets around the definite article were a powerful - if accidental - visual echo of internment, of being cut off and enclosed. Plus taking away the definite article from these terms, used by both interners and internees, emphasises the skewed ‘normality’ of a skewed situation where evocative, and even disturbing, words became everyday parlance.",,,,,,,,The following archive resources have been re-used: PMA Website - Glossary,https://apps.proni.gov.uk/eCatNI_IE/SearchPage.aspx,"Poster, Exhibition Number 02",poster_exno_02,"Glossary image reproduced with permission from the Prisons Memory Archive and Cahal McLaughlin",https://rightsstatements.org/page/InC/1.0/?language=en,Poem Poster,image/jpeg,eng,,,,,

From this starting point I wanted to focus on the place itself. So I began with the drawing of one of the blocks, that is here in the background. 
While I was reading, I noticed that a lot of what was written and said about the events in those blocks started with the letter h. I incorporated these words as form of ‘found poetry’ into my poster. I did not use any words that were not mentioned, with one exception, ‘the hope’. I included this to demonstrate people who will and have visited the PMA might have a sense of history being documented and, hopefully, hope for the future.

poster_exno_04,poster_exno_04.jpg,Escape from Armagh Gaol,2023,,Creative Storyteller,,"I wanted to be more imaginative with my poster. I decided to write a poem because there were so many questions I had after watching the extract from Evelyn and Cate’s story. In the video clip Evelyn explains the escape attempt from prison. Something I know happened in real life but still feels like something from Hollywood movies to me personally. What really struck me about their story was that they put their make-up on before they even left and had different clothes waiting for them, as part of their escape strategy. So they could pretend like they were going to a party.

Brian called the artwork (that is visible on the poster) ‘this magnificent thing’ and this was my starting point for the poem. The drawing captured the trapped individual, and everybody is trapped from all sides when they are in prison. If you look closely at the right eye of the drawing, it captured a look of sadness and bewilderment - yet alert. And this might be the way the person who drew this felt while in imprisoned.",,,,,,,,"The following archive resources have been re-used: PMA Recording from Brian Maguire (D4616/2/1/101/1);

I found this video of Jenny Meegan who says: “It's hard to believe they lived in such a grey colorless world”. She shares her experience of bringing a flower with her into the prison and all the prisoners being really captivated by it. This made me think of how much of our understandings of prisons comes from the fact that they are spaces that we are not allowed into, especially historic prisons. The PMA and everyone who contributed to it created access to memories and a part of history that would not be available otherwise.

On the last page it outlined this distinction between conforming prisoners and protesting prisoners, which really stood out to me. I found it very interesting to see and discover how they were both treated differently within the prison. I wanted to visualise on my poster that protesting prisoners had a clear message and demands they communicated, hence the speech bubble on the first page.

poster_exno_09,poster_exno_09.jpg,Let's go Maze,2023,,Creative Storyteller,,I was looking into the brochures and it just struck me how the Northern Ireland Office were trying to make prison life look very positive in their publications. Which is obviously not what the reality was like. I was looking for an ad template and then really built up the farce of what had been published in these brochures. The words that I've taken are partially compiled from either witness testimonies or from the brochures themselves. In my poster I wanted to expose how positive the NIO wrote about things like the prison uniforms.

They said the scariest part of being in the prisons was actually getting to the prison. They didn't know what way to go and they felt kind of lost, and when I saw those words, the name  - maze - itself resonated with me. I used a blueprint or rather map of the h-blocks and overlayed it with the picture of a maze. I also included the photograph of a person modelling prison clothes for a publication by the Northern Ireland Office from 1980.

poster_exno_12,poster_exno_12.jpg,Smuggled in,2023,,Actor,,"The story that gripped me was the one about the protesters at Armagh Gaol.  If they went to the B-wing, they were only allowed 30 minutes of visitation rights a month. This is a very small amount of time and I wondered how that affected the prisoners and their families emotionally. There was a short video from Angela where she is talking about smuggling alcohol into the prisons in balloons. This image stood out to me because the idea of women smuggling balloons filled with alcohol by putting them down their tops made me laugh a little. It also shows that among all the darkness of the stories that can come with prison memories their can be funny - or rather dark humor - elements.

This idea of whether you could have a normal time in such a difficult space. I kept thinking about the visits being very regulated and regimented. When it was really just time with your family which is not normally regulated or regimented for most people. I tried to make the poster playful, almost looking like a child’s drawing.

First the amount of bureaucracy that was involved in prisons visits. This turned something as simple as meeting your family into a big and difficult task that depended on filling out forms and official procedures. The second thing that struck me was the difference that the prisoners described when they were meeting their family or their friends.
